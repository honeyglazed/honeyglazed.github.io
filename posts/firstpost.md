I have always wanted to have my own personal website since the early days of my undergrad when *everyone* was building portfolio sites to impress potential employers. HTML+CSS+JS seemed daunting at first - was I really supposed to write all this from scratch?

 Nevertheless, the open-source community is amazing and practically anyone can simply slap on a theme in their favorite framework and call it day.
