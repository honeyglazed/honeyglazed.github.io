		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to have my own personal website since the early days of my undergrad when &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; was building portfolio sites to impress potential employers. HTML+CSS+JS seemed daunting at first - was I really supposed to write all this from scratch?&lt;/p&gt;
